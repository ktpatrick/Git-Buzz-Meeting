    "**remote** - a remote is an external repository that the local repository syncs with.  A given repository can have more than one remote.  Standard remotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- origin -- default remote repository (i.e, the GitHub repo if you clone a repository from github)\n",
    "\n",
    "**branch** - a branch is a set of code changes that are kept separate from the main code base (or trunk) in a git repository. A branch can be worked on in isolation until one wants to merge the changes back into the trunk. Git makes it easy to create branches both in your local repository and in a remote. Standard branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- master -- default development branch\n",
    "- HEAD   -- current branch\n",
    "- HEAD^  -- parent of head\n",
    "- HEAD~4 -- the great-grandfather of head\n",

    "## Set up a Git Configuration\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Adding some customization\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Clark Kent\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"clark.kent@dailyplanet.com\"\n",

    "git config --global push.default current\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Git Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "### From an existing repo\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git://host.org/myproject.git # an external GitHub Repo though HTTPS\n",
    "git clone ssh://you@somehost.org/project.git # through SSH\n",
    "git clone ~/some/repo.git ~/new/repo.git # #through the filesystem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### From a new project\n",

    "cd ~/myproject\n",
    "git init # intialize the repo\n",
    "git add . # add the folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stashing - Moving changes to the side\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git stash` command lets you put aside a set of changes so that you can pull updated code from a remote.  You can then either re-apply your stash of changes to the updated code files or discard them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git stash -- save modified and staged changes and them remove them from current branch.\n",
    "git stash list -- list stack-order of stashed file changes\n",
    "git stash pop -- worte working from top of stash stack\n",
    "git stash drop -- discard the changes from top of stash stack\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git <command> --help #pull up documentation for a <command>\n",

    "git status -- check which files have been changed in the working directory\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "git reset --hard Revert back to the last state WARNING THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE\n",
    "\n",
    "git rm <somefile> -- remove the file both from your git repository and from the file system, adding the removal to the next commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "git mv <old_file_path> <new_file_path> -- move a file that is already versioned in git from one location to another, adding the change to the next commit.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been doing the \"solo\" workflow, which looks something\n",
    "like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    " > mkdir my_working_directory\n",
    " > cd my_working_directory\n",

    " > touch some_file.py\n",

    "  # more hacking\n",
    "```\n",

    "working by yourself. When you're working in a team, it's useful to\n",
    "have a more structured workflow. Here we'll talk about the Github flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the GitHub flow, *we never code anything unless there is a need to.*\n",
    "When something needs to be done, we create an **issue** on the GitHub repository\n",
    "for it. *Good* issues:\n",
    "- Are clear\n",
    "- Have a defined output\n",
    "- Are actionable (written in the imperative voice)\n",
    "- Can be completed in a few days (at most)\n",

    "of your project. You can think of it as an undo button, a lab notebook, and a tool to safely and efficiently collaborate with others on a shared project, all rolled into one.\n",
    "All serious software projects use version control.\n",

    "While git is mostly used in software development, it can be used for anything you like\n",
    "([writing books](https://www.gitbook.com/), for example), as long as your files are plain text\n",
    "(e.g., source code, $\\LaTeX$  files).\n",
